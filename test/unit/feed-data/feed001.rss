				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Friday saw the launch of Partisan&#8217;s first stand-alone exhibition and it was swell to see so many faces there! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fantastic and incredibly lovely Hilary O&#8217;Mahony took residency in the fourth floor space from Friday 15th to Sunday 17th July with her thought-provoking exhibition <i>whatever it amounts to&#8217; </i></span></p>
<p>Made in response to an overwhelmingly large number of discarded scratch cards in Southern Manchester, Hilary explored value, identity and self-pursuit in collecting and de-contextualising these found objects. To cite her own words on the exhibition: “The lottery is an emotionally charged game. It creates many conflicting feelings, most notably luck, hope and disappointment&#8230;it positions the national lottery as a lens through which [these] societal concepts are explored”.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the launch night, we had a pay-what-you-can bar, music, tote bags for sale, highly ad hoc furniture, a good dose of mood lighting and reams of captivating conversation. Hilary was on site at Partisan HQ all weekend to discuss the works with all visitors and it was an all-round good-vibes experience!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are also very lucky to have caught her as she moves back to Ireland this week. We wish her all the best with the move and if you are based in Éire, keep your eyes peeled for her name in any galleries or arts centres! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the meantime, do visit her <a href="http://hilaryomahony.com/">website</a> – it&#8217;s got some great photos of the pieces included in <i>whatever it amounts to </i>and you can check out her work from past exhibitions as well.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>When you’re involved with any kind of grassroots campaign or activist group, it can be hard to find the time and space to reflect on how much you’ve achieved. We’re constantly looking ahead. When’s the next meeting? The next fundraiser? The next deadline?</strong></p>
<p>But reflection is such a valuable tool. Looking back at successes and achievements is reinvigorating and provides a huge boost to morale. Taking the time to discuss any problems that you’ve encountered is also worthwhile, and can make the path ahead clearer.</p>
<p>As June comes to a close, so we are taking a moment to reflect on what Partisan has achieved over the last month.</p>
<p>The main focus for Partisan has been fundraising for our permanent space. Following a fantastic <a href="http://partisancollective.net/event/manchester-city-of-queer-hope/">event</a> at the Cities of Hope festival in May, we started off our fundraising efforts for June at Islington Mill with <a href="http://partisancollective.net/event/slut-drop-x-force-majeure-partisan-fundraiser/">SLUT DROP x Force Majeure</a>. It was great to be able to let our collective hair down and we partied into the early hours!</p>
<p>The next weekend we put on a <a href="http://partisancollective.net/event/swap-a-partisan-fundraiser/">clothes, record, and book swap</a> at 3space. The day was topped off with delicious homemade cakes and our resident Partisan DJs playing some tunes.</p>
<div id="attachment_289" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-289" src="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-28-at-20.53.07.png" alt="clothing rails full of dresses and other clothes" width="500" height="589" srcset="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-28-at-20.53.07.png 506w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-28-at-20.53.07-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Just a few of the clothes from the SWAP fundraising event</em></p></div>
<p>And the weekend after that was the <a href="http://partisancollective.net/event/elevator-day-party-a-partisan-fundraiser/">Elevator Day</a> fundraiser at Fallow Café, which was another successful and fabulous party. Looking back, we’ve been pretty busy with fundraising! And that’s sure to continue over the rest of the summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_290" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-290" src="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay.jpg" alt="Having a boogie at the Elevator Day party" width="500" height="500" srcset="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay.jpg 960w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay-150x150.jpg 150w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay-300x300.jpg 300w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay-768x768.jpg 768w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ElevatorDay-750x750.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Having a boogie at the Elevator Day party</em></p></div>
<p>At the beginning of the month we had just about settled in to our temporary space at 3space Manchester. Since then, our meeting space has been used by so many wonderful groups: Manchester Radical Mental Health, Ladyfest Manchester, Manchester Punk Festival, Greater Manchester Housing Action, Picket the Profiteers, and Manchester People’s Assembly Committee.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-90" src="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n.jpg" alt="Our temporary space has been getting a lot of use!" width="500" height="500" srcset="http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n.jpg 852w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://partisancollective.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13165896_574661089377641_4962087220932333251_n-750x750.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Our temporary space has been getting a lot of use!</em></p></div>
<p>The demand from this huge range of groups goes to show how valuable an established Partisan space would be to the activists, artists, creatives and communites of Manchester.</p>
<p>It’s been heartening and inspiring for us to look back at our events calendar and see so many names there. We’ll be continuing to work towards securing a permanent space for these groups &#8211; and many more &#8211; to come together and create.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved with creating a much-needed DIY space in Manchester, come along to our next <a href="http://partisancollective.net/event/partisan-general-meeting/">general meeting</a>. Partisan will be meeting at 3space this Saturday (July 2nd) and will meet on the first Saturday of the month from now on. We hope to see you soon!</p>
