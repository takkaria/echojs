One becomes the leading lobby-watchdog in Brussels, the other one becomes a top lobbyist on world trade issues, representing 50% of the EU&#8217;s economy &#8211; banks, insurances, telecoms, touristic operators and a wide range of business federations.</p> <p>By following one&#8217;s investigations and the other&#8217;s career this film takes us on a journey into the corridors of power of the biggest economy on earth &#8211; the European Union. In the form of a docu-thriller, THE BRUSSELS BUSINESS tries to answer a question millions of Europeans ask themselves: Who runs the European Union?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><iframe width='645' height='363' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JEaK2OteEws?feature=oembed' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday 28th October 2014, 7pm.</p> <p><strong>Admission (includes free popcorn):</strong><br /> £7 &#8211; solidarity (optional)<br /> £5 &#8211; waged<br /> £3 unwaged/student<br /> Low/No Wage &#8211; donations only</p> <p><strong>Venue:</strong> <a title='Yard Theatre, Hulme' href='http://www.manchesterfilmcoop.uk/find-us/yard-theatre-hulme/'>Yard Theatre, 41 Old Birley Street, Hulme, Manchester.
